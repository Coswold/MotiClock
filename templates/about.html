            morning, or maybe you just need an extra boost during the day?
            Rejuvinate your motivation tank with Moticlock. Set MotiClock for
            the time you want to wake up, or a time where you need
            some extra motivation and let MotiClock take care of the rest.
            No snooze button included...</p>
